        <p>Welcome to the South American section of the Global Zoo. There are many animals indigenous to North Aemrica such as the Flamingo, Sea Lion, Mountain Lion, and Iguana. Here's some information about each of them.</p>

    <div class="flamingo">
        <h1>Flamingo</h1>
        <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3204/2677679721_d83303424a.jpg" alt="flamingo"> American <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/american-flamingo">flamingos</a> are one of the largest species of flamingo. Found in the Caribbean and along the northern coast of South America, these extraordinarily social birds live in flocks that sometimes number in the thousands. A pigment in their food gives their feathers their flamboyant pink color. A flamingo's plumage is a distinctive pink color with black flight feathers along the edges of the wings. It has a slender body and very long legs, a long, flexible neck and a small head. The flamingo's bill has a characteristic downward bend. Compared with its long legs, a flamingo's feet are relatively small. The front three toes are webbed, and the back toe is either tiny or missing altogether. Flamingos walk easily and can run when threatened. </p>

    <div class="sealion">
        <h1>Sea Lion</h1>
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/California_sea_lion_in_La_Jolla_%2870568%29.jpg" alt="sealion"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear"> Sea lions</a> are pinnipeds characterized by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, the ability to walk on all fours, short and thick hair, and a big chest and belly. Together with the fur seals, they make up the family Otariidae, eared seals. The sea lions have six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion) in five genera. Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean.[1] They have an average lifespan of 20-30 years </p>

    <div class="mountainlion">
        <h1>Mountain Lion</h1>
        <p><img src="https://good-nature-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/01/CEEBB3A9-2F28-46EE-8A06-1DCF9A8C793C.jpeg" alt="mountainlion"> The <a href>mountain lion</a> —also known as the cougar, puma, panther, or catamount—is a large cat species native to the Americas. Mountain lions are large, tan cats. Their bodies are mainly covered in tawny-beige fur, except for the whitish-gray belly and chest. Black markings decorate the tip of the tail, ears, and around the snout. Mountain lions vary hugely in average body size depending on geographic location—their size is smallest closer to the equator and largest closer to the poles. Generally, though, males weigh between 115 and 220 pounds (52 and 100 kilograms) and females weigh between 64 and 141 pounds (29 and 64 kilograms).</p>

    <div class="iguana">
        <h1>Iguana</h1>
        <p><img src="https://d2zp5xs5cp8zlg.cloudfront.net/image-89972-800.jpg" alt="iguana"> <a href="https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/iguana">Iguanas</a> found in the Americas, with their whiplike tail making up about half of that length. Like other reptiles, iguanas are cold-blooded, egg-laying animals with an excellent ability to adapt to their environment. Iguana species vary greatly in size, color, behavior, and their endangered status in the wild. Some, like the green iguana, are quite common; others, like Fiji’s banded iguanas, are endangered. Iguanas native to San Diego County are the desert iguana and the chuckwalla.</p>
