        <p>Welcome to the North American section of the Global Zoo. There are many animals indigenous to North Aemrica such as the Bald Eagle, Brown Bear, Jaguar, and Rattle Snake. Here's some information about each of them.</p>

These regal birds aren't really bald, but their white-feathered heads gleam in contrast to their chocolate-brown body and wings. Look for them soaring in solitude, chasing other birds for their food, or gathering by the hundreds in winter. Once endangered by hunting and pesticides, Bald Eagles have flourished under protection.</p>

        <h1>Brown Bear</h1>

It is one of the largest land carnivorans, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males are larger and more compactly built than females. The pelage ranges from reddish to yellowish-brown, and dark brown to cream in color. It evolved large hump muscles, unique among bears, and wide 21 to 36 cm (8.3 to 14.2 in) long paws to effectively dig through dirt. Its teeth are similar to those of other bears and reflect its dietary plasticity.</p>

        <h1>Jaguar</h1>

Jaguars have unusually large, round heads, short legs and a stunning coat dotted with dark rosettes and spots. They often live near water and are good swimmers. A jaguar's ultra-strong jaws and teeth can bite through a crocodile skull or turtle shell, but they'll prey on almost any wild animal they come across - including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Jaguars are currently Near Threatened. However, with its forest home increasingly being destroyed, and conflict growing with farmers and ranchers, the remaining jaguar population is declining under serious pressure.</p>

        <h1>Rattlesnake</h1>
        <p><img src="https://www.treksw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rattlesnake-1.jpg" alt="rattlesnake"> <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Reptiles/Rattlesnakes">Rattlesnakes</a> are highly specialized, venomous reptiles with large bodies and triangle-shaped heads. They are one of the most iconic groups of North American snakes due to the characteristic “rattle” found at the tip of the tail. The rattle is composed of a series of interlocking scales, which the snake adds to each time it molts. Muscle contractions cause the scales to click together, resulting in a rattling sound. A number of different rattlesnakes live in the United States, and they range in size from the one-foot (0.3-meter) ridge-nosed rattlesnake to the five-to-eight-foot (1.5-to-2.4-meter) eastern diamondback.</p>
