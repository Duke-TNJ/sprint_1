            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">Giant Panda</a> is a bear species that is endemic(found in a single defined geographical location) 
            to China. These bears are famous for their white coat with black patches around the eyes. Adult Giant Panda's weigh 220 to 250lbs and are 
            typically 4ft to 6ft long. These pandas live excusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to 3,000m or 9,800 ft.
            The Giant Panda has often served as China's national symbol, appearing on Chinese Gold Panda coins since 1982 and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 
            2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing. As a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the 
            lowland areas where it once lived. The wild population has increased again to 1,864 individuals as of March 2015. Since 2016, it has been listed as 
            Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also classified the giant panda as vulnerable.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger">Tiger</a> is the largest living cat species native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a 
            large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. The Tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates
            (large mammal with hooves), which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals 
            of the same sex. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and 
            Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered 
            on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat 
            destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_leopard">Snow Leopard</a> species is native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. 
            It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and 
            is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is mainly threatened by poaching and habitat destruction following infrastructural development. 
            It inhabits alpine and subalpine zones at elevations of 3,00-4,500 m ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau 
            to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. The snow leopard's fur is whitish to grey with black spots on the head and neck, with larger 
            rosettes() on the back, flanks and bushy tail. Its muzzle is short, its forehead domed, and its nasal cavities are large. The snow leopard shows several 
            adaptations for living in cold, mountainous environments. Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss, and its broad paws effectively distribute its 
            weight for walking on snow.

            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_cobra">King Cobra</a> is a venomous snake endemic to Asia. It is not taxonomically a true cobra, despite 
            its common name and some resemblance. With and average length of 3.18 to 4 m and a record length of 5.85 m, it is the world's longest venomous snake. The 
            King Cobra is widely distributed albeit not commonly seen, with a range spanning from the Indian Subcontinent through Southeastern Asia to Southern China. 
            It preys chiefly on other snakes, including those of its own kind. This is the only ophidian that constructs an above-ground nest for its eggs, which are 
            purposefully and meticulously gathered and protected by the female throughout the incubation period. The threat display of this elapid includes spreading its neck-flap,
            raising its head upright, making eye contact, puffing, hissing and occasionally charging. Given the size of the snake, it is capable of striking at a considerable 
            range and height, sometimes sustaining a bite. Envemonation from this species is medically significant and may result in a rapid fatality unless antivenom is 
            administered in time.
