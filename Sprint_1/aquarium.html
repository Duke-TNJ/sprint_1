                These fish are not aggressive and coexist harmoniously with other non-aggressive tankmates.
                They’re also expert bottom feeders and natural scavenger fish. 
                As part of the Corydoras family, Albino Cory Catfish are considered a schooling fish, which means they thrive in the company of their own kind.

            <p> <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.jadO3MPazypSHO2aluitpwHaE8?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain"> The <a href="https://en.pet.wiki/wiki/Neon-Tetra-Paracheirodon-innesi">Neon Tetras</a> originate from the Rio Putumayo catchment area in eastern Peru.
                There they live in stagnant tributaries in densely forested areas, with brown, tannin-rich water and dense riparian vegetation.
                In the wild, neon tetras feed primarily on small insects, insect larvae and plankton.
                They are swimming, peaceful schooling fish and well suited for a community tank with other, not too large and peaceful fish.
                At least 5, but preferably much more Neon Tetras should be kept together.
                The sexes are difficult to distinguish. The females are somewhat stronger and larger.
